/* Pi0.5 as an frt_model_runtime_v1 producer (the generic model-runtime face).
 *
 * The standard hand-off for hosts: instead of the model-specific
 * frt_pi05_runtime_* verbs, a host receives one frt_model_runtime_v1 and
 * drives it through the generic port/stage/verb contract
 * (flashrt/model_runtime.h). Pi0.5 semantics map onto it as:
 *
 *   port "images"  IN  STAGED  IMAGE   set_input <- frt_image_view[] in the
 *                                      declared camera-view order
 *   port "prompt"  IN  STAGED  TEXT    adopted-export path: prompt embedding
 *                                      is prepared by the producer before
 *                                      capture; non-empty updates are refused
 *                                      (a native tokenizer producer lifts this
 *                                      without changing hosts)
 *   port "noise"   IN  SWAP    TENSOR  the diffusion seed window — the host
 *                                      writes raw bytes directly
 *   port "actions" OUT STAGED  ACTION  get_output -> unnormalized f32 robot
 *                                      actions (capacity/written in bytes)
 *   stage 0                            the configured infer graph
 *
 * This is the model-specific ADAPTER construction path
 * (frt_model_runtime_wrap): identity/fingerprint inherit from the export.
