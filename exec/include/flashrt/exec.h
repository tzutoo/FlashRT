/* FlashRT Execution Contract — public C ABI (the "spec").
 *
 * The common execution layer over FlashRT's "kernelize + CUDA Graph replay"
 * core. It fixes MECHANISM only, never scenario POLICY.
 *
 *   IS  : a replayable graph node + named I/O buffers + zero-copy buffer
 *         hand-off + shape-variant select + multi-stream/event/priority +
 *         imperative host-driven replay.
 *   NOT : sessions, KV append/fork/evict semantics, schedulers, OpenAI/MCP
 *         protocols, sensor/cadence orchestration, family/latency tags.
 *
 * Layering: this layer has ZERO dependency on csrc/ kernels. It captures
 * whatever the `record` callback enqueues onto a stream (FlashRT kernels,
 * torch ops, or raw CUDA) and only ever sees streams / graphs / events. That
 * independence is exactly why it lives in its own top-level `exec/` layer,
 * sibling to (not inside) the kernel layer csrc/. Its hardware backend axis
 * (cuda today, hip/... later, under exec/backend/) is orthogonal to the
 * per-kernel hardware backends in csrc/.
 *
 * Pure C ABI so Python (dev), Rust (server shell), C++ and on-robot hosts can
 * all link the same `libflashrt_exec`. Capture intelligence (autotune /
 * calibrate) stays in the Python frontend; this layer owns only the
 * replay-time contract + buffer registry.
 *
 * Design rationale: docs/exec_contract.md
