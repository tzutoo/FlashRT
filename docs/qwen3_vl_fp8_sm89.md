# Qwen3-VL-8B official FP8 on RTX 4090 (SM89)

This path brings up Qwen3-VL-8B on Ada RTX GPUs using the official
Qwen3-VL FP8 checkpoint. It is the SM89 counterpart to the SM120/NVFP4
Qwen3-VL path, but it intentionally uses the checkpoint's native block-scaled
FP8 language weights instead of NVFP4.

## Checkpoint

Use the official FP8 checkpoint:

```text
Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8
```

The language stack tensors are stored under
`model.language_model.layers.*`. Linear weights are
`torch.float8_e4m3fn` with `weight_scale_inv` block scales in a 128x128
layout. The vision tower in this checkpoint is BF16.

## Build

Build the regular FlashRT kernels and the Qwen3-VL helper module for SM89:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DGPU_ARCH=89 -DFLASHRT_BUILD_QWEN3_VL=ON
cmake --build build -j --target flash_rt_kernels flash_rt_fa2 flash_rt_qwen3_vl_kernels
```

The SM89 Qwen3-VL path uses:

- `flash_rt_kernels` for generic helpers shared with other RTX paths, such as
  embedding lookup, RMSNorm, residual add, and the base attention/runtime
  support.
- `flash_rt_fa2` for BF16 FlashAttention.
- `flash_rt_qwen3_vl_kernels` for Qwen3-VL-specific kernels: SM89 FP8
  block-128 GEMV/GEMM, fused norm/activation quantization, QK norm/RoPE/KV
  write, BF16 cuBLASLt ViT matmul wrappers, Qwen3 postprocessing, and the
  existing SM120 vision RoPE / layernorm-GELU-to-FP8 / BF16 bias epilogues.

## Runtime Architecture

The runtime frontend is
`flash_rt.frontends.torch.qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89_multimodal.Qwen3VlFp8Sm89Frontend`.

The text-only language core is
`flash_rt.frontends.torch.qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89.Qwen3VlFp8Sm89TextFrontend`.

The dtype mapping is:

| Component | SM89 dtype path |
|---|---|
| Language weights | Official block-scaled FP8 e4m3, 128x128 scales |
| Language activations before linears | BF16 -> per-token/per-128 FP8 |
| Language GEMV/GEMM output | BF16 |
| Attention Q/K/V cache | BF16 |
| Attention backend | BF16 FA2 |
| Residual stream and norms | BF16 |
| Vision protected blocks | BF16 |
| Vision bulk GEMMs | FP8 block-128 activation/weight, BF16 output |
| `lm_head` default | FP8 block-128 |

`use_fp8_lm_head=True` is the default for the SM89 FP8 path because the
vocabulary projection is a large decode-time weight read. For BF16 reference
validation or deployment comparisons, construct the frontend with
`use_fp8_lm_head=False` or pass `--no-fp8-lm-head` to
`scripts/smoke_qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89.py`.

## Quickstart

```bash
python examples/qwen3_vl_quickstart.py \
  --arch sm89 \
  --checkpoint /path/to/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8 \
  --image FlashRT.png \
  --prompt "Describe this image in one sentence." \
  --max-seq 2048
```

By default, the SM89 prefill buffer is sized to `max_seq`, matching the SM120
Qwen3-VL frontend. Pass `--max-prefill-seq` only to deliberately lower that
capacity.

For the development smoke benchmark:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89.py \
  --checkpoint /path/to/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8 \
  --multimodal \
  --iters 5 \
  --generate-tokens 0
```

The full-resolution `FlashRT.png` workload produces 6256 vision patches and
1581 language tokens. This is the workload used for the SM120 Qwen3-VL report,
so it is the preferred comparison point for full TTFT numbers.

## RTX 4090 Validation

Environment:

- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, SM89
- Checkpoint: official Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8
- Workload: `FlashRT.png`, prompt `Describe this image in one sentence.`
- Prompt shape: 6256 vision patches, 1581 language tokens

Command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/smoke_qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89.py \
  --checkpoint /path/to/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-FP8 \
  --multimodal \
  --iters 3 \
  --generate-tokens 0
```

Result (RTX 4090, sm_89, empty card, iters=30, median):

```text
S=1581 pixel_shape=(6256, 1536) spans=[(4, 1568)]
set_prompt_warm median=12.594 ms

language_only_no_mm_scatter median=106.863 ms

```

vs the initial PR #111 numbers (iters=3 at PR time): `prefill_graph`
206.214 → 193.183 ms (**-6.3%**), `graph_decode` 10.681 → 9.284 ms
(**-13.1%**), `language_only_no_mm_scatter` 120.634 → 106.863 ms (-11.4%),
`vision_only` 88.990 → 82.009 ms (-7.8%). The decode gain comes from the
decode-path work on this branch (BF16-input GEMV skipping the FP8 activation
quant for O-proj / lm_head / qkv / gate_up, BF16-output RMSNorm feeding the
bf16in GEMV, 512-thread decode norm for 8B occupancy, gate/up GEMV fusion,
last-layer residual + final RMSNorm fusion); the prefill gain is dominated by
the small-M 32x64 GEMM tile (short prefill, M<256) plus cross-layer norm
fusion and kernel-lookup caching. Large-M prefill GEMM (the FlashRT.png
single-image workload, M=1581) is L2-bandwidth-bound at ~84% L2 / 42% compute
/ 33% occupancy and was not further optimized on this branch.

Text-only decode (`--text-only`, iters=30, median):

```text
S=79 prefill median=12.641 ms (8B) / 6.586 ms (2B)
graph_decode_pos=63 median=8.715 ms (8B) / 2.361 ms (2B), cos_vs_eager=1.000000
```

8B text decode 9.213 → 8.715 ms, 2B text decode 2.552 → 2.361 ms vs the
2026-07-05 branch baseline.

The same workload on the SM120/NVFP4 path is faster because it uses Blackwell
NVFP4 language kernels. The SM89 path is intended to use the best available
Ada-compatible dtype path: official FP8 language weights, BF16 attention and
residual state, and FP8 `lm_head` by default.

## Limits

- This is not an NVFP4 implementation. SM89 uses official FP8 weights because
  NVFP4 is a Blackwell path.
- FP8 `lm_head` is the default; use `use_fp8_lm_head=False` or
  `--no-fp8-lm-head` for BF16 reference comparisons.
- Single-image prefill has a CUDA Graph replay path. Multi-image and video
  should use the eager path unless separately validated.
- Decode graphs are captured per cache position because the FA2 call captures
  host-side sequence length.
- The development scripts under `scripts/*qwen3_vl_fp8_sm89*` are local
  validation and profiling entry points, not CI replacements.

## Why this path is hand-written (no TMA on Ada)

The SM120 Qwen3-VL path runs its block-128 FP8 GEMM through the CUTLASS
`KernelTmaWarpSpecializedBlockwise` collective: TMA bulk-copy engines feed a
warp-specialized producer/consumer pipeline, and CUTLASS auto-selects a deep
(3-4 stage) software pipeline. That design hides global-load latency *without*
spending registers or occupancy on the staging.

Ada (sm_89) has **no TMA and no warp-specialized CUTLASS collective** (those
builders are Sm90+/Sm120 only), so that design does not port. Two consequences
shape this kernel:

- **GEMM** is a hand-written `cp.async` + `ldmatrix.x4` + block-128-scaling MMA
  kernel (`fp8_block128_gemm_mma_sm89.cu`). With `cp.async` instead of TMA, each
  extra pipeline stage costs a full shared-memory buffer, and at the tuned
  64x64 tile the kernel is already register-limited to 4 CTA/SM — so a 2-stage
  pipeline halves occupancy and regresses. It runs single-stage and is
  latency-bound; the obvious memory-pattern optimizations (load/store
  coalescing, `ldmatrix`) are applied, and CUTLASS's own Ada blockwise example
  is slower than this kernel, so it is not used.
- **Attention** uses the vendored FlashAttention-2 (Tri Dao) kernels, including
  an added hdim64 instantiation for the 2B ViT; the FA2 kernel body is upstream
  and is not modified here.

Net: the SM89 path matches the SM120 design *intent* (block-128 FP8, fused
act/norm-quant, ldmatrix-based MMA) but cannot reuse the TMA/warp-specialized
machinery, which is the main reason its prefill is slower than the Blackwell
NVFP4 path.
